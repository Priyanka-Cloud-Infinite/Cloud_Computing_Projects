### Designing High Availability AWS Infrastructure
## Project Description
This is a medium difficulty level project. Based on the reference architecture diagram, we will design high available system. We will create AMI for our desired EC2 Instances which will be bootstrapped for starting an Apache Webserver. We will create load balancers, launch configurations and auto scaling groups. We will run 2 EC2 instances in different public subnets and it gets auto provisioned when old EC2 Instances are down.
